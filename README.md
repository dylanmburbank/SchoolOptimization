# SchoolOptimization
This project was an assigned final project for Optimization Methods II, a course taken during my Master of Science Candidacy at UNH. Due to poor school funding laws and a large diversity in socioeconomic conditions throughout the state, education inequality is a major issue in New Hampshire. For this project my partner and I decided to start from scratch, and reassign the population from NH towns to schools. Although we were in agreement that each town did not need a school, we felt that it would be adequate if each town either had a school inside of it, or in the town adjacent to it to ensure more equitable access for all students. Towns with higher population are given the most weight, and certain constraints were added to towns with populations over 2,000 students so schools did not become overcrowded.
